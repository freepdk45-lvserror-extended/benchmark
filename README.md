# Orchestrating LLM-Based Agents for Flexible LVS Error Debugging in VLSI Physical Design
LLM-based agent framework for automating the process from LVS checking to error debugging in a flexible manner, leveraging both the adaptability and other capabilities of LLM.

This library is made up of modified layouts of the FreePDK45 standard cells, incorporating LVS errors such as TextOpen, UnusedText, PortSwap, and Unexpected errors.

## Dataset Description
All file structures follow the architecture of FreePDK45.

The extended libraries are contained at benchmark/freepdk45-v14-extended/ncsu-FreePDK45-1.4-extended/FreePDK45/osu_soc/lib.

(freepdk45_cells_LVSFail_TextOpen, freepdk45_cells_LVSFail_UnusedText, freepdk45_cells_LVSFail_PortSwapError, freepdk45_cells_LVSFail_Unexpected)
