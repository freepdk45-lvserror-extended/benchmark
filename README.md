# Automating LVS Fixing with Neuro-Symbolic Approach
A system combining a symbolic sub-system implemented as a tailored multi-agent framework and a neural sub-system based on an LLM.

This library is made up of modified layouts of the [FreePDK45](https://eda.ncsu.edu/freepdk/freepdk45/) standard cells, incorporating multiple LVS errors such as Property, PortSwap, UnunsedText, TextShort, and TextOpen errors.


## Dataset Description
- All file structures follow the architecture of FreePDK45. 

- The extended library is contained at benchmark/freepdk45-v14-extended/FreePDK45-1.4-extended/osu_soc/lib.
